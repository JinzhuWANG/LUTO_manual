    "LUTO-2 (hereafter referred to as LUTO) is version two of the Land-Use Trade-Offs model. The model is an agricultural model comprised by 4 parts: 1) Land-use map, 2) Productivity maps, and 3) Resources (water, monetary, biodiversity) consumption maps and 4) an optimizer. LUTO predicts future spatial land-use distributions based on an economic cost-minimisation or profit-maximization logic under various constraints. "

The `Demand` is sourced from external modelling considering Australia's imports, exports, diets, et cetera; the `productivity map` is driven by different climate change predictions; and the `resource requirement map` is acquired through paper review and stakeholder collaborations. Users can specify their assumptions by choosing parameters in the `settings.py` file. "

This manual converts the 1D array back to its original 2D format and visualize the process of arranging land-use map to meet demand targets under water, GHG, and biodiversity constraints."
